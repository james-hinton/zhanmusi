        <h4>IPP CommonSensing </h4> As one of the lead developers, I worked on
        the UKSA-funded IPP CommonSensing project, which is the largest funded
        project by the UK Space Agency. This project was for government
        stakeholders in Fiji, Vanuatu, and the Solomon Islands, under the
        Satellite Applications Catapult. My work involved software development
        using Python, JavaScript, Redis, Dojo, and Jinja2, as well as deployment
        on Linux servers and the use of Docker / Kubernetes / Helm.

        I worked on the STAC Asset Catalog management platform for Satellite
        Applications Catapult, developing a range of backend API's and
        microservices using Django and Flask. I deployed and integrated these
        services using Terraform, and utilized various Azure services such as
        Application Gateways, App Services, ACI, and ACR. I also built a
        user-friendly frontend using React, which allows users to easily manage

        <h4>ConspiraSea </h4>I worked as a software developer for the

        lobby government, large organizations, fishing companies, and other
        stakeholders to better protect Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) from
        industrial-scale fishing. One of the standout features of this project
        is the use of leaderboards to highlight industrial fishing vessels that
        are fishing in MPAs, along with the vessel operators, owners, and
        company group structure they are part of. ConspiraSea was entered into
        the Hack the Planet Competition run by the Commonwealth and the
        Satellite Applications Catapult.
